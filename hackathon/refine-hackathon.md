# The refine Open Source Hackathon #2

We're back with another exciting event for the open-source community - the 2nd refine Open Source Hackathon! 

As with the first, this Hackathon is about showcasing your skills, creativity, and innovation using refine.

**[refine](https://github.com/refinedev/refine)** is a React-based framework for the rapid ‚ú® development of CRUD web applications. It eliminates the repetitive tasks demanded by CRUD operations and provides industry-standard solutions for critical parts like authentication, access control, routing, networking, state management, and i18n. refine shines on data-intensive applications like admin panels, dashboards, internal tools and storefronts. 


‚è∞ The Hackathon kicked off on June 21, and we're proud to host it in collaboration with the DEV platform.

üëâ **Refer to refine Open Source Hackathon [official announcement post](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-refine-dev-hackathon-29fn).**

üöÄ The prizel pool is **$10,000** in total and a special gifts along with **limited edition** swag kits!



üîî To stay updated on the official start of the Hackathon, please join us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/refine) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/refine_dev).

## Together with Open Source Community



refine draws its strength from the open-source community, and we are grateful to have the support of [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/), which has significant contributions to the community. We're proud to host our second Hackathon on collaboration with the [DEV](https://dev.to/refine) platform. 

It's worth noting that refine has built-in [data provider support](https://refine.dev/docs/packages/documentation/data-providers/supabase) for Supabase and [UI framework integration](https://refine.dev/docs/api-reference/mui/) for Material UI. So we believe they will be excellent backend and UI solutions for your hackathon project.

Supabase and MUI will also be providing swag kits for the winners.
