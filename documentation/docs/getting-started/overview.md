## What is refine?

refine is a react-based framework that enables rapid development of web applications. It eliminates the repetitive tasks demanded by **CRUD** operations and provides industry standard solutions for critical parts of a project like **authentication**, **access control**, **routing**, **networking**, **state management**, and **i18n**.

**refine** is _headless by design_, offering unlimited styling and customization options.

## What do you mean by "headless" ?

Instead of being limited set of pre-styled components, **refine** is a collection of helper `hooks`, `components` and `providers`. These are all decoupled from your _UI components_ and _business logic_, so they never keep you from customizing your _UI_ or coding your own flow.

**refine** works _seamlessly_ with any custom design or UI framework you may favor. For convenience, it ships with ready-made integrations for Ant Design System, Material UI, Mantine, and Chakra UI.

## Use cases

**refine** shines when it comes to _data-intensive_ applications like _admin panels_, _dashboards_ and _internal tools_. Thanks to the built-in **SSR support**, **refine** can also power _customer-facing_ applications like _storefronts_.
