## Inferencer

Inferencer is a powerful tool in the **refine** ecosystem that helps developers quickly generate CRUD (create, read, update, delete) pages for their data model. It analyzes your data model based on the resource scheme and automatically creates the pages with the required forms and tables for CRUD operations.

#### Why use Inferencer?

There are several benefits to using Inferencer:

1. The goal of Inferencer is to reduce the amount of time spent on creating views for resources by generating the code automatically. This can save developers a significant amount of time and effort, especially on large projects with many resources.

2. Code generated by Inferencer is also easy to customize. Instead of starting from scratch, you can use the auto-generated code as a starting point and make changes to it according to your needs. This allows you to quickly iterate and get your project up and running faster.

3. By using Inferencer, you can also avoid common mistakes that can arise when building CRUD pages manually. This can help you avoid bugs and other issues that can arise during development.

Overall, using Inferencer will greatly speed up development time and reduce the amount of code that needs to be written manually. It helps ensure that your CRUD pages are consistent and adhere to best practices, allowing you to focus on more complex tasks instead.

You can Learn more about [how Inferencer works](../../../packages/documentation/inferencer.md) and [how to use it with Material UI](../../../api-reference/core/components/inferencer.md) in our documents.

## How to use Inferencer

The `@pankod/refine-inferencer` package provides the `<HeadlessInferencer/>` component, which can be imported from `@pankod/refine-inferencer/headless`. It used to generate CRUD pages based on your API response.

Before we start using Inferencer, we need to add `@pankod/refine-react-hook-form` and `@pankod/refine-react-table` packages to our project. Since these packages are used by Inferencer to generate forms and tables, they need to be installed in our project.

<Tabs
defaultValue="npm"
values={[ {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'}, {label: 'pnpm', value: 'pnpm'}, {label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'} ]}>

<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm i @pankod/refine-react-table @pankod/refine-react-hook-form
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm i @pankod/refine-react-table @pankod/refine-react-hook-form
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @pankod/refine-react-table @pankod/refine-react-hook-form
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Then, we need to add the `<HeadlessInferencer/>` component which is used by passing appropriate values to the `resources` prop of the `<Refine/>` component in `App.tsx` as shown below:

:::info

The resources prop will be explained in detail in [Unit 4](../../3-understanding-resources/0-intro.md). For now, you can assume that the resource is a collection of data on your API used in the app.

:::

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
import { Refine } from "@pankod/refine-core";
import routerProvider from "@pankod/refine-react-router-v6";
import dataProvider from "@pankod/refine-simple-rest";
//highlight-next-line
import { HeadlessInferencer } from "@pankod/refine-inferencer/headless";

const App = () => {
    return (
        <Refine
            routerProvider={routerProvider}
            dataProvider={dataProvider("https://api.fake-rest.refine.dev")}
            //highlight-start
            resources={[
                {
                    name: "products",
                    list: HeadlessInferencer,
                    show: HeadlessInferencer,
                    create: HeadlessInferencer,
                    edit: HeadlessInferencer,
                },
            ]}
            //highlight-end
        />
    );
};
export default App;
```

At this point, **refine** will automatically generate the CRUD pages for the `products` resource based on the API response.

## Preview the auto-generated pages

So far we have added complete CRUD pages by utilizing the Inferencer feature to the project. Let's take a look at the auto-generated CRUD pages that Inferencer handles for us.

Before we start, let's understand the API that we will be using in this tutorial. We will be using the https://api.fake-rest.refine.dev API. This API is created by the **refine** team and is used for demo purposes. It is a simple REST API that contains some resources like `products`, `categories`, etc.

:::info

How **refine** apps communicate with the API via the `dataProvider` will be explained in [Unit 3](../../2-understanding-dataprovider/0-intro.md).

:::

You can view the code generated by Inferencer by clicking the "Show Code" button in the right corner of the live preview below.

### List Page

To preview the list page, go back to your browser and open the <a href="localhost:3000" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">localhost:3000</a> address.

You should see the list page for the `products` resource that was generated by Inferencer like below:

:::note
When you navigate to the `localhost:3000`, **refine** will redirect you to the initial resource's list page registered to `<Refine/>` component like `localhost:3000/products`
:::

```tsx live previewOnly previewHeight=600px url=http://localhost:3000/products
setInitialRoutes(["/products"]);

import { Refine } from "@pankod/refine-core";
import routerProvider from "@pankod/refine-react-router-v6";
import dataProvider from "@pankod/refine-simple-rest";
import { HeadlessInferencer } from "@pankod/refine-inferencer/headless";

const App = () => {
    return (
        <Refine
            routerProvider={routerProvider}
            dataProvider={dataProvider("https://api.fake-rest.refine.dev")}
            resources={[
                {
                    name: "products",
                    list: HeadlessInferencer,
                    show: HeadlessInferencer,
                    create: HeadlessInferencer,
                    edit: HeadlessInferencer,
                },
            ]}
        />
    );
};
render(<App />);
```

### Create Page

To preview the create page, go back to your browser and go to <a href="localhost:3000/products/create" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">localhost:3000/products/create</a> or click the "Create" button on the list page.

You should see the create page for the `products` resource that was generated by Inferencer like below:

```tsx live previewOnly previewHeight=600px url=http://localhost:3000/products/create
setInitialRoutes(["/products/create"]);

import { Refine } from "@pankod/refine-core";
import routerProvider from "@pankod/refine-react-router-v6";
import dataProvider from "@pankod/refine-simple-rest";
import { HeadlessInferencer } from "@pankod/refine-inferencer/headless";

const App = () => {
    return (
        <Refine
            routerProvider={routerProvider}
            dataProvider={dataProvider("https://api.fake-rest.refine.dev")}
            resources={[
                {
                    name: "products",
                    list: HeadlessInferencer,
                    show: HeadlessInferencer,
                    create: HeadlessInferencer,
                    edit: HeadlessInferencer,
                },
            ]}
        />
    );
};
render(<App />);
```

### Edit Page

To preview the edit page, go back to your browser and go to <a href="localhost:3000/products/edit/123" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">localhost:3000/products/edit/123</a> or click the "Edit" button on the record in the list page.

You should see the edit page for the `products` resource with the id `123` that was generated by Inferencer like below:

```tsx live previewOnly previewHeight=600px url=http://localhost:3000/products/edit/123
setInitialRoutes(["/products/edit/123"]);

import { Refine } from "@pankod/refine-core";
import routerProvider from "@pankod/refine-react-router-v6";
import dataProvider from "@pankod/refine-simple-rest";
import { HeadlessInferencer } from "@pankod/refine-inferencer/headless";

const App = () => {
    return (
        <Refine
            routerProvider={routerProvider}
            dataProvider={dataProvider("https://api.fake-rest.refine.dev")}
            resources={[
                {
                    name: "products",
                    list: HeadlessInferencer,
                    show: HeadlessInferencer,
                    create: HeadlessInferencer,
                    edit: HeadlessInferencer,
                },
            ]}
        />
    );
};
render(<App />);
```

### Show Page

To preview the show page, go back to your browser and go to <a href="localhost:3000/products/show/123" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">localhost:3000/products/show/123</a> or click the "Show" button on the record in the list page.

You should see the show page for the `products` resource with the id `123` that was generated by Inferencer like below:

```tsx live previewOnly previewHeight=600px url=http://localhost:3000/products/show/123
setInitialRoutes(["/products/show/123"]);

import { Refine } from "@pankod/refine-core";

            dataProvider={dataProvider("https://api.fake-rest.refine.dev")}
            resources={[
                {
                    name: "products",
                    list: HeadlessInferencer,
                    show: HeadlessInferencer,
                    create: HeadlessInferencer,
                    edit: HeadlessInferencer,
                },
            ]}
        />
    );
};
render(<App />);
```
